    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of 'python' as a core set of libraries (the python standard libraries) that contain the basic python data structures (`int`, `str`, `list`, `dict`, etc.) and functions (`print()`, `len()`, `sum()`, etc). We can add additonal data structures and functions to core python. Developers group related functions and data structures into *packages* wich we add to core python to increase its functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "On winstat, we are working with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution of python. The Anaconda distribution bundles together basic python with common and useful packages such as\n",
    "* numpy: functions for numerical computing (ln(), exp(), sqrt(),...) \n",
    "* scipy: functions for math and engineering (statistical functions, signal processing, linear algebra...)\n",
    "* matplotlib: a plotting interface (bar, scatter, time series plots,...)\n",
    "* pandas: functions and data structures for data analysis (data management, merging, grouping...)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the semester, when you move away from winstat, you can install Anaconda (it's free) on your own computer and continue your python adventures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda already *installed* the packages for us, but we still need to tell python that we want to use the packages. This way, we only load into memory the packages we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add a package we use the `import` statement. For example, to load the numpy package, we use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "The statement says to add the numpy package (import it) and to give it a shortened name of 'np'. We don't have to use the name np --- we could name it George --- but np is short and informative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we want a shorter name than numpy? When we use a function from the numpy package, we use the dot notation. Here, we use the [log function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.log.html):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "x = np.log(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `np.` tells python to look for the `log()` function in the package called np. Python knows that np means numpy, and everything works. \\[See why calling it George would have looked strange?\\]\n",
